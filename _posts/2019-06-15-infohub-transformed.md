## Welcome !!!

Regular Visitors will have noticed that things have changed around here, quite a bit!

For ease of navigation, enhanced growth potential, and to further its open-source, public-domain, principles - I have split my github repositories into 4 organizations.

## New Organizational Structure

Now all of my content, and forked repositories, are divided among 4 organizations and my user account. Part of the benefit of arranging them so, is that I can make use of multiple custom domains, which the other repositories build off of like they have infominer.id.

This also makes them less about me, and hopefully these organizations will grow their own communities of participants who also enjoy the educational experience of creating and maintaining these resources.

My user account still hosts this website, and my [github portfolio](https://infominer.id/repo-portfolio/) which I haven't dug into deeply, yet.

### 4 Organizations

These links lead to the posts, here on my homepage. That way, I'll always be able to announce any significant updates here, and show off featured content, as it develops.

* [Web-work.tools](web-work-tools/)
  * [Indieweb](web-work-tools/#web-work-toolsindieweb)
* [SourceCrypto](source-crypto/)
  * [Bitcoin History](source-crypto/#bitcoin-history)
  * [Crypto Transcripts](source-crypto/#transcripts)
* [DIDecentral](identity-decentralized/)
* [Learn Crypto Trading](#learn-crypto-trading)

There are a few more web-sites under development, which you can discover by browsing the Organizations on GitHub.

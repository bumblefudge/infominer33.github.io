Perhaps you've browsed these sites and wondered about contributing, but aren't sure where to start. In this post, I'd like to begin explaining how to contribute.

I will start with the simplest ways, that require the least effort from you

## On GitHub

I welcome any issues or pull requests for question, comments, or contributions of any type. Its too early for strictly defined content that would not be accepted, but to be simple:

* No Spam
  * No Ref Links
  * No ICOs (unless its about the announcement for a project that started in 2015 or earlier, or is from a major multinational corporation.
  * Rules are made to be broken, in specific instances, when incentives aline.

That caveat aside. Neither myself, or any of these websites will be a shill. My rule is if I wouldn't do it for free, then I won't do it for money. Same goes for contributing to this website, you can pay for my attention and focus, and for including content on the site, perhaps even featured. But only if it's of a similar (or better) quality to what would be featured anyways.

### "Edit This Page" 

![](https://imgur.com/t0Si4aE.png)

Nearly every page, on each of the sites I operate has a section like this, where you can share or edit on GitHub.

You can always click that button, and click edit again, via github, then type whatever you want, and I will see and respond.

Whether it's an actual improvement fully functioning w proper markup, or simply a note. DOn't be afraid, even if your change isn't perfect, I'll try to accept it and do what I need to include your commits, which are a record of your contribution. Though I'm not a GitHub professional, quite yet, and can't make promises.

## /bookmark-donations/

If you would export me a copy of your bookmarks.... that would be great!

## @ mention on twitter

You can simply @mention @didecentral on twitter, for anything essential, decentralized identity related.

## Contributing Via Discord

Discord is, hands down, the easiest way to contribute to these resources. I share posts to the channels of various discord servers I operate, throughout my day, on the fly... mostly on smoke breaks.



### 4 Organizations

These links lead to the posts, also found via my homepage. This way, I can announce updates, and show off featured content, for each of the organizations, as they develop.

* [DIDecentral](/identity-decentralized/)
* [Web-work.tools](/web-work-tools/)
  * [Indieweb](/web-work-tools/#web-work-toolsindieweb)
* [SourceCrypto](/source-crypto/)
  * [Bitcoin History](/source-crypto/#bitcoin-history)
  * [Crypto Transcripts](/source-crypto/#transcripts)
* [Learn Crypto Trading](/LCT-learn-crypto-trading/)

There are a few more web-sites under development, which you can discover by browsing the Organizations on GitHub.


## Back with more soon

This is just a rough draft and will grow to include much more.

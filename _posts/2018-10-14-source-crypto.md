**Research Index-Discord Chat**

<a href="http://crypt0library.net" target="_blank"><img src="https://sourcecrypto.pub/images/Square-Crypto.png" align="right" width="200" height="200"></a>

I keep up with [news.ycombinator.com](news.ycombinator.com), and follow cryptographers, developers, academics, cypherpunks, maximalists, generalists, enterprise, traders, and the like on Twitter — re-tweeting valuable information to collect, organize and catalog in the 100+ channels of [Source⧉Crypto Discord Chat](https://discord.gg/ahTuPMY). 

Beyond that more passive information collection, I also heavily research the background of subjects I write about.

I've gradually been figuring out the best ways to structure that data, generate pages with it, and create dynamic resources that are fine-tuned to the users research needs.

This is just the beginning of what is becoming an epic repository of knowledge.

## Bitcoin History

<img src="https://sourcecrypto.pub/bitcoin-history/assets/img/BitcoinHistory.png"/>

I'm fascinated by all the history surrounding Bitcoin, and tech generally, but especially any aspects that directly relate to Bitcoin in some fashion. I've found it easier to understand blockchain and cryptocurrency, going back over their histories... cryptography, one-way hash functions, public key encryption... Important to recall is that state suppression of cryptography is the #1 cause of blockchain mania.

It took Bitcoin to get governments to go along with crypto-innovations, for the public anyhow. From the beginning of the digital age, industry was discouraged from becoming too creative with cryptography. For example, in the US and allied nations, there were strict export controls on encryption unless the government could crack it.

Now Bitcoin has forced the hand of industry and the state, to try and catch up with the cypherpunk tech.

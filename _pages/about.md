## Motivational Rant

You might think that I'm smart or special, but I'll tell you that being smart or special never got me anywhere in life. 

The truth is boring: this is a ton of work and I do nothing else.
{: .notice--success}

There are so many opportunities in tech. I've only spent the last year really dedicated to learning blockchain deeply, which also includes having a well rounded knowledge of the surrounding fields and history of computing.

It sounds like a lot, but probably not too much more work than most any college student, and less work than plenty.

Point being. If you have the way at all where you can devote yourself to tech, DO IT. Whatever time you do have, learning the tools to publish on github is a gateway to learning to code.  

Even if you don't wanna code, knowing how to use GitHub means you can participate in open-source projects, and being able to publish web content is AWESOME!!! (and not even that hard!!!!!!)

## It's Not About Me

I'm not interested in writing about myself. The story of my life might be interesting to some people, but at this point would offer little practical value to the world. I'm not great or awesome, I'm just seizing this opportunity where the talent market in tech is starved, and there are a multitude of ways to earn a living after a few years of training. 

This opportunity is available only because the masses are still headed off to the debt machine rather than seizing their own destiny. This is a particular window of opportunity, especially with blockchain where everything I just wrote about tech writ large is magnified in effect.


## Growing Up

{% include video id="h5iROlujV88" provider="youtube" %}


I've loved computers since I was young, this was as the digital world was transitioning from BBS's and local freenets to Compuserve, AOL, and JUNO. 

I always considered myself a skilled operator of computers, but wasn't disciplined enough to learn any languages, tho I made a few starts at it. I had no conception how the internet would change the world, and there was no such thing even as cell phones, yet. 

I've always been a seeker of truth. Growing up, I had passionate beliefs, and I knew that those beliefs required a firm intellectual basis. 

What I learned was that there *was* no firm intellectual basis for the beliefs I so passionately embraced. Rather, the firmest intellectual foundation I could grasp was entirely the opposite of what I was raised to believe, and independently asserted as my own.

As a big reader from a young age, it was easy for me to see that the educational system was just as baseless as everything else I was raised to believe in. I quickly realized, that likewise, any faith in the government as some benevolent actor in my interests was just as unfounded.

While my youth was intellectually stimulating, it suffered socially, and so I really had no glue sticking me to the herd. From there I disengaged as much as possible from the path where you're expected to go into a bunch of debt to become a dutiful taxpayer, make babies, and keep your hedges trimmed.

## Dropping Out 

I saw everything as pointless, including activism where you can clearly see that "the system" has a built in defense mechanism protecting it from meaningful remediation.

What is the point to living in a world built on lies intended to create slaves who think they are free? Where children are stronghanded into taking on insurmountable debt and choose what they should do with their life before they know anything about the world.

Then keep everyone so busy just to survive and keep up with the jonses, no-one has any time for personal development. Take a pill, watch tv, pay your taxes... oh yeah, and by the way, will you feed your children our industrial waste products if we make them look and taste sort of like food?

## Turning On

So i smoked weed, drank booze, dropped acid and participated in all sorts of activities with real sensory enjoyment and a visceral benefit, under no duress or because of any web of lies, but the ones I told myself.

That resulted in a bunch of stupid and ridiculous behaviour, exactly to the extent that you'd expect from a ferral intoxicated intellectual. It's like every movie about drugs, in the beginning everything is awesome, but but habits escalate and have negative consequences for anyone who refuses to get out and grow up while the getting is good.

## Digital Transformation

A few years ago, embarking upon a considerable life transition, I began practicing content creation, with the idea of trying to earn a living as a writer. I figure that since I love reading more than anything else, I can make a career out of reading, somehow. To begin with, writing seemed the most likely route.

So I began learning best practices, following information to its source, properly citing images and information, creative commons, markdown, html, etcetera. 

I also became disgusted with the quality of content overall, on the web. I've always had a special ability to focus on topics of interest, whos whose veracity is important to me.

When I began creating content for hire, around the start of 2018, it was very important to me to be as accurate as possible with everything I write. Especially considering I knew nothing about any of these subjects before I began writing. 

I advertised blockchain research, because I had already come into some gigs like that before I even started freelancing. I also advertised articles (no shilling, only research based content) on Blockchain and Data Science, and wrote quite a lot of that, though plenty was ghostwritten and not sure if ever published or what became of most of it.

My clients during that time had a considerable influence on what I learned, but it was a good introduction to the crypto market and tech at large. Since I gave up working at that lame freelancing site, I've dedicated myself completely to curation and creating my own content via github pages.

## Crypto-Anarchy

The deeper I've learned about Bitcoin, and its roots, the more at home I've felt in this community. I relate particularly to the cypherpunk\cyberpunk communities. I recall as a kid coming across cyberpunk propaganda, though I didn't know it by that name. I do remember Cult of the Dead Cow, and all sort of juvenile, but substantive, literature.

Information Was Meant to be Free.
{: .notice--success}

I know anonymity isn't in fashion.. I hear because some folk figured out they could make more money by using their name. 

Also that in the beginning people were anon, out of fear that the govt would persecute Bitcoiners.. so where that is obviously not happening and it's more legitimized, then yes more people want their name associated with it.

Well.. that aint me. Throughout my life, any efforts I've made towards attention\approval seeking have only led to frustration. 

Like many others, I fell victim to the idea that being famous or popular is desirable. 

Over it!

This page, and my home page are what you'll get as far as anything "about me" goes. 

The technology available, and the free tools that can empower you to have an impact on the world in a positive way... the tech and the knowledge surrounding it are far more compelling than I could ever hope to be... with my peronality, haha. 
{: .notice--success}

Anyways, we have the tools for reputation and public key cryptography made easy with keybase.... why lean so heavy on outmoded business practices?

I'm leaning into the Bitcoin Revolution.

This is all just a quick, hello because I felt so inspired. Will come back and fill in \ clean up later.

That's all for now, Thanks!

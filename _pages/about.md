## Motivational Rant

You might think that I'm smart or special, but I'll tell you that being smart or special never got me anywhere in life. 

The truth is boring: this is a ton of work and I do nothing else.
{: .notice--success}

There are so many opportunities in tech. I've only spent the last year really dedicated to learning blockchain deeply, which includes cultivating a well-rounded knowledge of the surrounding fields and history of computing.

It sounds like a lot of work, and it is. But its probably not much more than any university student, and surely less than many of them.

Point being. If you have the way at all where you can devote yourself to tech, DO IT. Whatever time you do have, use it wisely. In a few years, once the world catches on a bit more, there will be far fewer opportunities available than there are today.

Learning the tools to publish on GitHub is a gateway to learning to code.  

Even if you don't wanna code, knowing how to use GitHub means you can participate in open-source projects, and being able to publish web content on a platform for collaborative\open-source development is AWESOME!!! (and not even that hard!!!!!!)

Plus, there are way more intelligent people hanging out doing awesome stuff, and it just might rub off on ya!

## It's Not About Me

I'm not interested in writing about myself. The story of my life might be interesting to some people, but at this point would offer little practical value to the world. 

I'm not great, or awesome, I'm just seizing this opportunity where the talent market in tech is starved, and there are a multitude of ways to earn a living after a few years of training. 

This opportunity is available only because the masses are still headed off to the debt machine rather than seizing their own destiny. 

This is a particular window of opportunity, especially with blockchain where everything I just wrote about tech, writ large, is magnified in effect.

## Growing Up

{% include video id="h5iROlujV88" provider="youtube" %}

I've loved computers since I was young, as the digital world was transitioning from BBS's and local freenets to Compuserve, AOL, and JUNO. 

I always considered myself a skilled operator of computers, but wasn't disciplined enough to learn any languages, tho I made a few starts at it. I had no conception how the internet would change the world, and there was no such thing even as cell phones, yet. 

I was always a seeker of truth. Growing up, I held passionate beliefs. I came to realize that such passionate beliefs required a firm intellectual basis.

What I learned was that there *was* *no* firm intellectual basis for the beliefs I so passionately embraced. Rather, the firmest intellectual foundation I could grasp was entirely the opposite of what I was raised to believe, and independently asserted as my own.

As a big reader from a young age, it was easy for me to see that the educational system was just as baseless as everything else I was raised to believe in. I quickly realized, that likewise, any faith in the government as some benevolent actor in my interests was just as unfounded as believing in the Easter bunny, or the tooth fairy. 

While my youth was intellectually stimulating, it suffered socially. As a result, I really had no glue sticking me to the herd. From there I disengaged as much as possible from the path where you're expected to go into a bunch of debt to become a dutiful taxpayer, make babies, and keep your hedges trimmed.

## Dropping Out 

I saw everything as pointless, including activism where you can clearly see that "the system" has a built-in defense mechanism protecting it from meaningful remediation.

What is the point to living in a world built on lies intended to create slaves who think they are free? Where children are stronghanded into taking on insurmountable debt and choose what they should do with their life before they know anything about the world.

Then keep everyone so busy just to survive and keep up with the jonses, no-one has any time for personal development. Take a pill, watch tv, pay your taxes... oh yeah, and by the way, will you feed your children our industrial waste products if we make them look and taste sort of like food?

## Turning On

So i smoked weed, drank booze, dropped acid and participated in all sorts of activities with real sensory enjoyment and a visceral benefit, under no duress or any web of lies, but the ones I told myself.

That resulted in a bunch of stupid and ridiculous behaviour, exactly to the extent that you'd expect from a feral intoxicated intellectual. It's like every movie about drugs, in the beginning everything is awesome, but habits escalate and have negative consequences for anyone who refuses to get out and grow up while the getting is good.

## Digital Transformation

A few years ago, embarking upon a considerable life transition, I began practicing content creation, with the idea of trying to earn a living as a writer. I figure that since I love reading more than anything else, I can make a career out of reading, somehow. To begin with, writing seemed the most likely route.

So I began learning best practices, following information to its source, properly citing images and information, creative commons, markdown, HTML, etcetera. 

I also became disgusted with the quality of content overall, on the web. I've always had a special ability to focus on topics of interest, whos whose veracity is important to me. 

{% include figure image_path="https://imgur.com/BLkkwkf.png" alt="The funny thing is, Our cells are completely regenerating every seven years." caption="We've already become completely different people several times over, and yet we always remain quintessentially ourselves." %}


When I began creating content for hire, around the start of 2018, it was very important to me to be as accurate as possible with everything I write. Especially considering I knew nothing about any of these subjects before I began writing. 

I advertised blockchain research, because I had already come into some gigs like that before I even started freelancing. I also advertised articles (no shilling, only research-based content) on Blockchain and Data Science, and wrote quite a lot of that, though plenty was ghostwritten and not sure if ever published or what became of most of it.

My clients during that time had a considerable influence on what I learned, but it was a good introduction to the crypto market and tech at large. Since I gave up working at that lame freelancing site, I've dedicated myself completely to curation and creating my own content via GitHub pages.

## Crypto-Anarchy

The deeper I've learned about Bitcoin, and its roots, the more at home I've felt in this community. I relate particularly to the cypherpunk\cyberpunk communities. I recall as a kid coming across cyberpunk propaganda, though I didn't know it by that name. I do remember Cult of the Dead Cow, and all sort of juvenile, but substantive, literature.

Information Was Meant to be Free.
{: .notice--success}

I know anonymity isn't in fashion.. I heard because some folk figured out they could make more money by using their name. 

Also in the beginning people were anon out of fear that the govt would persecute Bitcoiners.. so where that is obviously not happening and it's more legitimized, then yes more people want their name associated with it.

Well.. that ain't me. Throughout my life, any efforts I've made towards attention\approval seeking have only led to frustration.

Like many others, I fell victim to the idea that being famous or popular is desirable. 

Over it!

Rather than try to promote my own self as a product, I will make a product around sharing information so compelling that it simply can't be ignored.

This page is what you'll get as far as anything "about me" goes. infominer.id describes my services and shows off my subjects of interest. I'll also be happy to show my progress with analytics and figures. Ideally this whole project will make it easier for anyone to get involved and work with these cutting edge technologies themselves.

Beyond that, I'm interested that information surrounding blockchain and cryptocurrency become easier for people to learn and know about. That is certain value, let's go with that.

## Revolutionary Day-Job?

Also, this is all an experiment, to see how over the top awesome my content needs to be, before I can turn cataloging information related to crypto my source of income?

I'm leaning into the Bitcoin Revolution.
{: .notice--success}

I think it's incredible... because I've been an anarchist for a while, but I never thought it was something you could make a living with. Bitcoin makes it possible if you object to privately owned and operated central banks silently overthrowing your government, while pretending to work for the government, there's no need to fight them! Just work to accelerate the adoption of Bitcoin, and other state-resistant currencies.

That's all for now. Thanks!

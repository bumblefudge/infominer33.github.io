## Motivational Rant

You might think that I'm smart or special, but I'll tell you that being smart or special never got me anywhere in life. The truth is boring: this is a ton of work and I do nothing else.

There are so many opportunities in tech. I've only spent the last year really dedicated to learning blockchain deeply, which also includes having a well rounded knowledge of the surrounding fields and history of computing.

It sounds like a lot, but probably not too much more work than most any college student, and less work than plenty.

Point being. If you have the way at all where you can devote yourself to tech, DO IT. Whatever time you do have, learning the tools to publish on github is a gateway to learning to code.  

Even if you don't wanna code, knowing how to use GitHub means you can participate in open-source projects, and being able to publish web content is AWESOME!!! (and not even that hard!!!!!!)

## It's Not About Me

I'm not interested in writing about myself. The story of my life might be interesting to some people, but at this point would offer little practical value to the world. I'm not great or awesome, I'm just seizing this opportunity where the talent market in tech is starved, and there are a multitude of ways to earn a living after a few years of training. 

This opportunity is available only because the masses are still headed off to the debt machine rather than seizing their own destiny. This is a particular window of opportunity, especially with blockchain where everything I just wrote about tech writ large is magnified in effect.


## Growing Up

I've loved computers since I was young, this was as the digital world was transitioning from BBS's and local freenets to Compuserve, AOL, and JUNO. 

I always considered myself a skilled operator of computers, but wasn't disciplined enough to learn any languages, tho I made a few starts at it. I had no conception how the internet would change the world, and there was no such thing even as cell phones, yet. 

Another important aspect of my youth, that I'd like to share, is that I've always been a seeker of truth. I had passionate beliefs, and those beliefs required a firm intellectual basis. 

What I learned was that there was no firm intellectual basis available for the beliefs I so passionately embraced. Rather, the firmest intellectual foundation I could grasp was entirely the opposite of what I was raised to believe, and what I independently asserted as my own.

As a big reader from a young age, it was easy for me to see that the educational system offered to me was just as baseless as everything else I was raised to believe in. I quickly realized also, that likewise, any faith in the government as some benevolent actor in my interests was just as unfounded.

While my youth was intellectually stimulating, it suffered socially, and so I really had no glue sticking me to the herd. From there I disengaged as much as possible from the path where you're expected to go into a bunch of debt to become a dutiful taxpayer and keep your hedges trimmed.

## Dropping Out

I saw everything as pointless, including activism where you can clearly see that "the system" has a built in defense mechanism protecting it from meaningful remediation.

What was the point to living in a world built on lies intended to create slaves who think they are free. Where children are stronghanded into taking on insurmountable debt and choose what they should do with their life before they know anything about the world.

Then keep everyone so busy just to survive and keep up with the jonses, no-one has any time for personal development. Take a pill, watch tv, pay your taxes... oh yeah, and by the way, will you feed your children our industrial waste products if we make them look and taste sort of like food?

## Turning On

So i smoked weed, and drank booze, and participated in all sorts of activities with real sensory enjoyment and a visceral benefit, under no duress or web of lies but those I told myself.

That resulted in a bunch of stupid and ridiculous behaviour, exactly to the extent that you'd expect from a ferral intoxicated intellectual. It's like every movie about drugs, in the beginning everything is awesome, but but habits escalate and have negative consequences for anyone who refuses to get out and grow up while the getting is good.

## Digital Transformation

A few years ago, embarking upon a considerable life transition, I began practicing content creation, with the idea of trying to earn a living as a writer. My idea was that since I love reading more than anything else, that I could make a career out of reading and writing seemed the most likely rout to do that.

So I began learning about best practices, following information to its source, markdown, etcetera. I also became disgusted with the quality of content overall, on the web. I've always been a seeker of truth, and have a focus when it comes to studying subjects whose veracity is important to me.

When I began creating content for hire, around the start of 2018, it was very important to me to be as accurate as possible with everything I write. Especially considering I knew nothing about any of these subjects before I began writing. 

I advertised blockchain research, because I had already come into some gigs like that before I even started freelancing. I also wrote many articles (no shilling, only research based content) on Blockchain and Data Science.

My clients during that time had a considerable influence on what I learned, but it was a good introduction to the crypto market and tech at large. Since I gave up working at that lame freelancing site, I've dedicated myself completely to curation and creating my own content via github pages.

That's all for now, Thanks!

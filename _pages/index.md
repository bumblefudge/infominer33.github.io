**My Goal: Create a reasonably comprehensive index for the ecosystem of information surrounding Bitcoin, Blockchain, and Cryptocurrency.**

All of the content *that I create* on `infominer.id` is open-source. At the Bottom of each page, you'll find an <a href="https://github.com/infominer33/infominer33.github.io/blob/master/{{ page.path }}" class="edit">Edit this page <i class="fa fa-pencil"></i></a> button, so you can contribute and\or see how it works behind the scenes.

So, I'm just gonna put this out there. When I have the time, I will write more and we can explore this topic together, in depth.

I just wanted to say that I'm not a genius. Rather, I feel like an idiot, on the daily. I'm smart in my own way, but mostly I work. A lot.

There are so many opportunities in tech. I've only spent the last year really dedicated to learning blockchain deeply, which also includes having a well rounded knowledge of the surrounding fields and history of computing.

It sounds like a lot, but probably not too much more work than most any college student, and less work than plenty.

Point being. If you have the way at all where you can devote yourself to tech, DO IT. Whatever time you do have, learning the tools to publish on github is a gateway to learning to code.  

Even if you don't wanna code, knowing how to use GitHub means you can participate in open-source projects, and being able to publish web content is AWESOME!!! (and not even that hard!!!!!!)


Hooray! I created this website at the beginning of the year, which was my first time publishing a web-page... even if it was only a couple clicks, and a few paragraphs to start.

I've loved computers since I was young, although I wasn't very involved with technology for most of my adult life. A few years ago, embarking upon a considerable life transition, I began practicing content creation, with the idea of trying to earn a living as a writer. My idea was that since I love reading more than anything else, that I could make a career out of reading and writing seemed the most likely rout to do that.

So I began learning about best practices, following information to its source, markdown, etcetera. I also became disgusted with the quality of content overall, on the web. I've always been a seeker of truth, and have a focus when it comes to studying subjects whose veracity is important to me.

When I began creating content for pay, it was very important to me to be as accurate as possible with everything I write. Especially considering I knew nothing about any of these subjects before I began writing. 

## Information Dense Content

I'm not a fast writer, or even particularly good at it. However, I love to learn, I value reliable sources and am a patient editor. When writing for my clients, I always ask plenty of questions, and show my progress, to ensure that I'm headed in the right direction.

I'm primarily interested in Bitcoin, *decentralized identity*, blockchain, cryptocurrencies, web-work, programming. I'm also quite interested in [data science](https://www.csbtechemporium.com/deep-learning-revolution/), although not nearly as much as I am crypto.

Having gathered information on a variety of subjects into GitHub repositories, I began learning [how to publish with GitHub Pages](https://infominer.id/gh-pages-starter-pack.html).


**I aim to create content of the highest quality - relating complex subjects in a clear and concise fashion - supplying essential details, with quality sources for further study.**

## Bitcoin History

<img src="https://infominer.id/bitcoin-history/assets/img/BitcoinHistory.png"/>

I'm fascinated by all the history surrounding Bitcoin, and tech generally, but especially any aspects that directly relate to Bitcoin in some fashion. I've found it easier to understand blockchain and cryptocurrency, going back over their histories... cryptography, one-way hash functions, public key encryption... Important to recall is that state suppression of cryptography is the #1 cause of blockchain mania.

It took Bitcoin to get governments to go along with crypto-innovations, for the public anyhow. From the beginning of the digital age, industry was discouraged from becoming too creative with cryptography. For example, in the US and allied nations, there were strict export controls on encryption unless the government could crack it.

Now Bitcoin has forced the hand of industry and the state, to try and catch up with the cypherpunk tech.

»»» So now that we've all lost our minds over crypto. »»»

## DID-Identity Decentralized

<img src="https://infominer.id/DIDecentralized/assets/img/identity-decentralized.png"/>

Over the past year, a number of different clients hired me to write about decentralized identity. One client had me write higher level (but technically precise, and exhaustive) introductory pieces for developers, to be included as part of their training courses for various Hyperledger and other blockchain training. So I decided to start making this resource. 

Decentralized-ID has become a passion. This is my most highly developed research project, to-date.

The rise of Bitcoin has brought new life to the quest for a decentralized - vendor agnostic - identity layer for the internet, that began around the early 2000's. Today, we are closer than ever to a sensible approach to identity online.

As far as I can tell, this is blockchain's breakthrough application, beyond currency. Efforts to create a decentralized identity layer for the internet have persevered since the early 2000's, experiencing surge of energy with the rise of Bitcoin, the GDPR, and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for all to have legal id by 2030. Plus.. Canadian governments are using a distributed ledger for their business registry, which will support a ton of useful technologies!!!!

Yay! so you can see created DIDecentralized (formerly named [/awesome-decentralized-id](https://github.com/infominer33/awesome-decentralized-id/graphs/contributors)) was created on November 11, 2019.

That's also when I began learning to use GitHub and Git.

## Learn Crypto Trading

![](https://infominer.id/learn-crypto-trading/assets/img/LCT.png){: .align-center}

Trading \ technical analysis is the subject I've studied the least, of almost anything, but this is my fastest growing repository (in followers) besides DIDecentralized (surprise surprise). 

My digital transformation tour-guide said that means it should have a heading here. Jokes aside, I do plan to study more and build out that site. Actually, I've hatched some cool plans to make it awesome!

<a href="http://crypt0library.net" target="_blank"><img src="https://infominer.id/SourceCrypto/assets/img/Square-Crypto.png" align="right" width="200" height="200"></a>

I keep up with [news.ycombinator.com](news.ycombinator.com), and follow cryptographers, developers, academics, cypherpunks, maximalists, generalists, enterprise, traders, and the like on Twitter — re-tweeting valuable information to collect, organize and catalog in the 100+ channels of [Source⧉Crypto Discord Chat](https://discord.gg/ahTuPMY). 

Beyond that more passive information collection, I also heavily research the background of subjects I write about.

I've gradually been figuring out the best ways to structure that data, generate pages with it, and create dynamic resources that are fine-tuned to the users research needs.

This is just the beginning of what is becoming an epic repository of knowledge.

## Services

I offer ***content creation*, *research consulting*, and *web publishing*** services.

### Research Consulting

<img src="https://infominer.id/assets/img/blockchain_research.png"/>

In-depth research is time-consuming. In crypto, the matter is made even more challenging because of the vast amount of domain knowledge required to obtain quality results. What I lack in experience, I make up for with relentless search habits.

I ask questions to ensure I understand what my clients need, and show my progress so we both know if I'm providing value.

I have a passion for crypto-related research, and would love to help with your information discovery.

### Content Creation

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/iAx8Vo6.png"/>

I'm experienced at writing on subjects that I previously knew little about. My primary focus is education, simplicity, and accuracy. I'm not a fast writer. 

I enjoy writing high-level overviews of blockchain platforms that can serve as an introduction to developers.  

---

**ISO clients who want Bitcoin-related content for their websites.**

---

One project I'm hoping to find a buyer for is a series of articles on the history leading to Bitcoin. 

**Rough Outline**
* History of Cryptography:
  * Public Key Encryption (currently only available in books)
  * Hash Algorithms
* Distributed Systems \ Consensus
* History of Cypherpunks
  * History of p2p networking
* History of open source
* History of The Federal Reserve
* History of Digital Currency Before Bitcoin 
* Birth of Bitcoin
* 2012-2016
* 2017

### Web-Publishing

![](https://i.imgur.com/asfJ5uS.png){: .align-center}
[*img source*](https://techooid.com/free-blog-jekyll-github){: .btn .btn--small .align-center }

It's rather simple to set up a site, via GitHub, but there are a number of tweaks that really make your site, such as, having proper metadata so that your preview text\image show up on various platforms.

Once its all set up, it will be easy for you to just add blog posts formatted in markdown. Whatever you're interested in... I'm already maintaining 5 of my own sites.. I don't see any harm in adding one more to the mix.

Perhaps you have an old site and you want it migrated, or want help with your existing GitHub pages site... who knows really. Just connect with me and we can discuss your needs.


## Support the Cause

I love to **Earn Bitcoin** working with kind folk such as yourself.

More than a job, I'd love to generate an income by creating this site, and making it the most comprehensive resource to learn about Bitcoin and the technologies\economies that surround it.

This site is a portfolio of research and content I've created over the past year.
{: .notice}

<img src="https://infominer.id/assets/img/infodisco.png"/>

**I aim to create content of the highest quality - relating complex subjects in a clear and concise fashion - supplying essential details, with quality sources for further study.**

I'm primarily interested in Bitcoin, *decentralized identity*, blockchain, cryptocurrencies, programming, and i've studied [data science](https://www.csbtechemporium.com/deep-learning-revolution/) quite a bit.

Having gathered information on a variety of subjects into github repositories, I began learning [how to publish with GitHub Pages](https://infominer.id/gh-pages-starter-pack.html).

Publishing allows me to organize information in a way that vastly expands my ability to learn and gather more information. Making these complex topics easier to navigate, and accessible for those who aren't able to spend most of their time studying crypto.

**My Ultimate Goal: Create a reasonably comprehensive index for the ecosystem of information surrounding Bitcoin, Blockchain, and Cryptocurrency.**


## Bitcoin History

<img src="https://infominer.id/bitcoin-history/assets/img/BitcoinHistory.png"/>

I'm fascinated by all the history surrounding Bitcoin, and tech generally, but especially any aspects that directly relate to Bitcoin in some fashion. I've found it easier to understand blockchain and cryptocurrency, by going back over the history of cryptography, one-way hash functions, and public key encryption. Important to recall is that state supression of cryptography is the #1 cause of blockchain mania.

It took Bitcoin to get governments to go along with crypto-innovations, for the public anyhow. Industry was on board a long time ago, to get creative with cryptography, but governments suppressed its use with strict export controls.

## DID-Identity Decentralized

<img src="https://infominer.id/DIDecentralized/assets/img/identity-decentralized.png"/>

Over the past year, a number of different clients hired me to write about decentralized identity, and I was getting pretty deep into it, when I decided to share the resources I had collected on GitHub. From there, it's turned into a passion. This is my most highly developed research project, to-date.

The rise of Bitcoin has brought new life to the quest for a decentralized - vendor agnostic - identity layer for the internet, that began around the early 2000's. Today, we are closer than ever to a sensible approach to identity online.

As far as I can tell, this is blockchain's breakthrough application, beyond currency. Efforts to create a decentralized identity layer for the internet have persevered since the early 2000's, experiencing surge of energy with the rise of Bitcoin.

## Learn Crypto Trading

![](https://i.imgur.com/w9UMUVG.png)

Trading \ technical analysis is the subject I've studied the least, of almost anything, but this is my fastest growing repository (in followers) besides DIDecentralized (surprise surprise). 

My digital transformation tour-guide said that means it should have a heading here. Jokes aside, I do plan to study more, and build out that site. Actually, I've hatched some cool plans to make it awesome!

**Research Index-Discord Chat**

<a href="http://crypt0library.net" target="_blank"><img src="https://infominer.id/SourceCrypto/assets/img/SourceCrypto.png" align="right" width="150" height="140"></a>

I follow cryptographers, developers, academics, cypherpunks, maximalists, generalists, enterprise, traders, etc. — re-tweeting valuable information to collect, organize, and catalog in the 100+ channels of [Source⧉Crypto Discord Chat](https://discord.gg/ahTuPMY). 

I've gradually been figuring out the best ways to structure that data, generate pages with it, and create dynamic resources that are fine-tuned to the users research needs.

This is just the beginning of what will become an epic repository of knowledge.

## Services

I offer ***content creation*, *research consulting*, and *web publishing*** services.

### Research Consulting

<img src="https://infominer.id/assets/img/blockchain_research.png"/>

In-depth research is time-consuming. In crypto, the matter is made even more challenging because of the vast amount of domain knowledge required to obtain quality results. What I lack in experience, I make up for with relentless search habits.

I ask questions to ensure I understand what my clients need, commonly checking in to show my progress and ensure I'm providing value.

I have a passion for learning, enjoy crypto-related research, and would love to help with your research needs.

### Content Creation

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/iAx8Vo6.png"/>

I'm experienced at writing on subjects that I previously knew little about. My primary focus is education, simplicity, and accuracy. I'm not a fast writer. 

I enjoy writing high-level overviews of blockchain platforms that can serve as an introduction to developers.

**ISO clients who want Bitcoin-related content for their websites.**

---

One project I'm hoping to find a buyer for is a series of articles on the history leading to Bitcoin. 

**Rough Outline**
* History of Cryptography:
  * Public Key Encryption (currently only available in books)
  * Hash Algorithms
* Distributed Systems \ Consensus
* History of Cypherpunks
  * History of p2p networking
* History of open source
* History of The Federal Reserve
* History of Digital Currency Before Bitcoin 
* Birth of Bitcoin
* 2012-2016
* 2017

### Web Publishing


It's rather simple to set up a site, via github, but there are a number of tweaks that really make your site, such as, having proper metadata so that your preview text\image show up on various platforms.

Once its all set up, it will be easy for you to just add blog posts formatted in markdown. Whatever you're interested in... I'm already maintaining 5 of my own sites.. I don't see any harm in adding one more to the mix.

Perhaps you have an old site and you want it migrated, or who knows really. Just connect with me and we can discuss your needs.

## Support the Cause

I would love to **Earn some Bitcoin**, working with you. But I will say, that taking time out to work means that I have less time to create these resources that are valuable, but difficult to generate income from. Feel free to send a donation and support the cause.

**I aim to create content of the highest quality - relating complex subjects in a clear and concise fashion - supplying essential details, with quality sources for further study.**

I'm primarily interested in Bitcoin, *decentralized identity*, blockchain, cryptocurrencies, programming in general, and [data science](https://www.csbtechemporium.com/deep-learning-revolution/).

After gathering information on a variety of subjects over the course of a year, I began learning [how to publish with GitHub Pages](https://infominer.id/gh-pages-starter-pack.html). Now, I have many more tools at my disposal for content creation.

**My Ultimate Goal: Create a reasonably comprehensive index for the ecosystem of information surrounding Bitcoin, Blockchain, and Cryptocurrency.**

This site is a portfolio of research and content I've created over the past year.

Publishing allows me to organize information in a way that vastly expands my ability to learn and gather more information. Making these complex topics easier to navigate, and accessible for those who aren't able to spend most of their time studying crypto.

## Bitcoin History

<img src="https://infominer.id/bitcoin-history/assets/img/BitcoinHistory.png"/>

I'm fascinated by all the history surrounding Bitcoin, and tech generally, but especially any aspects that directly relate to Bitcoin in some fashion. It's easier to understand blockchain and cryptocurrency, if you start near the beginning with one-way hash functions, and public key encryption, and you can trace the efforts of people through the years to create, and the efforts of states to suppress encryption. 

Most of blockchain mania could be solved with plain old encryption, but encryption was suppressed for so long, it took Bitcoin to get governments to go along with crypto-innovations, publically anyhow. Industry was on board a long time ago to be creative with cryptography, but governments suppressed it. So now that we're all losing our minds... What even is Crypto?>>>>

## DID-Identity Decentralized

<img src="https://infominer.id/DIDecentralized/assets/img/identity-decentralized.png"/>

Over the past year, a number of different clients hired me to write about decentralized identity, and I was getting pretty deep into it, when I decided to share the resources I had collected on GitHub. From there, it's turned into a passion. This is my most highly developed research project, to-date.

The rise of Bitcoin has brought new life to the quest for a decentralized - vendor agnostic - identity layer for the internet, that began around the early 2000's. Today, we are closer than ever to a sensible approach to identity online.

As far as I can tell, this is blockchain's breakthrough application, beyond currency. Efforts to create a decentralized identity layer for the internet have persevered since the early 2000's, experiencing surge of energy with the rise of Bitcoin.

## Learn Crypto Trading

![](https://i.imgur.com/w9UMUVG.png)

Trading \ technical analysis is the subject I've studied the least, of almost anything, but this is my fastest growing repository (in followers) besides DIDecentralized (surprise surprise). 

My digital transformation tour-guide said that means it should have a heading here. Jokes aside, I do plan to study more, and build out that site. Actually, I've hatched some cool plans to make it awesome!

## Sourceâ§‰Crypto 

**Research Index-Discord Chat**

<a href="http://crypt0library.net" target="_blank"><img src="https://infominer.id/SourceCrypto/assets/img/SourceCrypto.png" align="right" width="150" height="140"></a>

I follow cryptographers, developers, academics, cypherpunks, maximalists, generalists, enterprise, traders, etc. â€” re-tweeting valuable information to collect, organize, and catalog in the 100+ channels of [Sourceâ§‰Crypto Discord Chat](https://discord.gg/ahTuPMY). 

I've gradually been moving those links from discord to Github in TOML format, to become a database that powers a dynamic web portal. From there, it's not so hard to spin up [github-pages](/notes.html) for it all.

## Services

I offer ***content creation* and *research consulting*** services.

### Research Consulting

<img src="https://infominer.id/assets/img/blockchain_research.png"/>

In-depth research is time-consuming. In crypto, the matter is made even more challenging because of the vast amount of domain knowledge required to obtain quality results. What I lack in experience, I make up for with relentless search habits.

I ask questions to ensure I understand what my clients need, commonly checking in to show my progress and ensure I'm providing value.

I have a passion for learning, enjoy crypto-related research, and would love to help with your research needs.

### Content Creation

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/iAx8Vo6.png"/>

I'm experienced at writing on subjects that I previously knew little about. My primary focus is education, simplicity, and accuracy. I'm not a fast writer. 

I enjoy writing high-level overviews of blockchain platforms that can serve as an introduction to developers.

One project I'm hoping to find a buyer for is a series of articles on the history surrounding Bitcoin. 

**Rough Outline**
* History of Cryptography:
  * Public Key Encryption (currently only available in books)
  * Hash Algorithms
* Distributed Systems \ Consensus
* History of Cypherpunks
  * History of p2p networking

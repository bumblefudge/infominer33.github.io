**My Goal: Create a reasonably comprehensive index for the ecosystem of information surrounding Bitcoin, Blockchain, and Cryptocurrency.**

While I'm at it, I might as well document the process as well, and make it super easy for others to create similar resources or even fork these to use the content in a creative way (hopefully also for free).

{% include figure image_path="https://infominer.id/assets/img/info-square.png" alt="Info Squared" caption="@Delpadschnick | [CryptoDesign.io](https://CryptoDesign.io)" %}

All of the content *that I create* on `infominer.id`, and any other websites I create via github pages, is open-source and public domain.

At the Bottom of each page, you'll find an <a href="https://github.com/infominer33/infominer33.github.io/blob/master/{{ page.path }}" class="edit">Edit this page <i class="fa fa-pencil"></i></a> button, so you can contribute and\or see how it works behind the scenes.

## Updates!!!

Yaya! Updates. Damn, I'm sorry, yall. I just noticed this page was full of old links. Keep an eye out, I'm working on the homepage, currently.

## Web Work

![](https://imgur.com/agY1edQ.png)

Hooray! I created this website at the beginning of the year, and it was my first time publishing a complete web-page... even if it was only a couple clicks, and a few paragraphs to start.

I started this journey trying to figure out how to earn online. While that's still a big part of it, I'm beginning to realize that I don't need to worry about how I will earn money. I just need to keep learning digital tools, and expanding my knowledge.

I'm gratefull to have enough runway where I can work at building this foundation, as though I'm in my own self-taught university. 

I decided to create a new site, although the directory structure hasn't really changed. I've simply consolidated a bunch of content related to my web-working journey into one blog-feed that will serve as the main blog for the site.

### Indieweb

{% include figure image_path="https://imgur.com/ahnVZ9tl.png" alt="All Your Webwork Tools Are Belong To Us." caption="[**infominer.id/indieweb**](https://infominer.id/indieweb)" %}


This is an interesting new subject to learn more about. Indieweb is all about taking control of your content, and using (w3c specified) webmentions to communicate from website to website, or syndicate content from social media sites directly to your web-site.

This is a little complicated because we are on github, where every change needs to be pushed to the repository and approved by me. If you run a wordpress website, there are many plugins that make it easy to set up.

I will have to work a little harder, but this is the decentralized web. If I'm into Bitcoin, and these new systems for decentralization, I think its important to support and promote systems for a decentralzied web that have nothing to do with bitcoin or cryptocurrency.

It will be good if many cryptocurrency related projects follow suit, and would be a show of good faith to that community, much of which thinks about as highly of 'crypto' as anyone. That is if we really care about a decentralized web, and not just the idea of getting rich from crypto.

## Bitcoin History

<img src="https://infominer.id/bitcoin-history/assets/img/BitcoinHistory.png"/>

I'm fascinated by all the history surrounding Bitcoin, and tech generally, but especially any aspects that directly relate to Bitcoin in some fashion. I've found it easier to understand blockchain and cryptocurrency, going back over their histories... cryptography, one-way hash functions, public key encryption... Important to recall is that state suppression of cryptography is the #1 cause of blockchain mania.

It took Bitcoin to get governments to go along with crypto-innovations, for the public anyhow. From the beginning of the digital age, industry was discouraged from becoming too creative with cryptography. For example, in the US and allied nations, there were strict export controls on encryption unless the government could crack it.

Now Bitcoin has forced the hand of industry and the state, to try and catch up with the cypherpunk tech.

»»» So now that we've all lost our minds over crypto. »»»

## DID-Identity Decentralized

<img src="https://decentralized-id.comized/images/identity-decentralized.png"/>

Over the course of a year, a few different clients hired me to write\research decentralized identity. One had me write higher level (but technically precise, and exhaustive) introductory pieces for developers, to be included as part of their training courses for various Hyperledger and other blockchain training. So I decided to start making this resource, because I had a lot of links collected. 

Decentralized-ID has become a passion, but also publishing content via GitHub pages. DIDecentralized is my most highly developed research project, to-date. I will continue to build and try new ways of sharing diverse related information.

**The rise of Bitcoin brought new life to the quest for a decentralized - vendor agnostic - identity layer for the internet, that began around the early 2000's.** 

Today, we are closer than ever to a sensible approach to identification and authentication online.

As far as I can tell, this is blockchain's breakthrough application, beyond currency. Efforts to create a decentralized identity layer for the internet have persevered since the early 2000's, experiencing surge of energy with the rise of Bitcoin, the GDPR, and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for all to have legal id by 2030. Plus.. Canadian governments are using a distributed ledger for their business registry, which will support a ton of useful technologies!!!!

You can see created DIDecentralized (formerly named [/awesome-decentralized-id](https://github.com/infominer33/awesome-decentralized-id/graphs/contributors)) was created on November 11, 2019.

That's also when I began learning to use GitHub and Git.

## Learn Crypto Trading

![](https://infominer.id/learn-crypto-trading/assets/img/LCT.png){: .align-center}

Trading \ technical analysis is the subject I've studied the least, of almost anything, but this is my fastest growing repository (in followers) besides DIDecentralized (surprise surprise). 

My digital transformation tour-guide said that means it should have a heading here. Jokes aside, I do plan to study more and build out that site, and have some cool plans to make it awesome!

**Research Index-Discord Chat**

<a href="http://crypt0library.net" target="_blank"><img src="https://sourcecrypto.pub/images/Square-Crypto.png" align="right" width="200" height="200"></a>

I keep up with [news.ycombinator.com](news.ycombinator.com), and follow cryptographers, developers, academics, cypherpunks, maximalists, generalists, enterprise, traders, and the like on Twitter — re-tweeting valuable information to collect, organize and catalog in the 100+ channels of [Source⧉Crypto Discord Chat](https://discord.gg/ahTuPMY). 

Beyond that more passive information collection, I also heavily research the background of subjects I write about.

I've gradually been figuring out the best ways to structure that data, generate pages with it, and create dynamic resources that are fine-tuned to the users research needs.

This is just the beginning of what is becoming an epic repository of knowledge.
